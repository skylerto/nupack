# Nupack

My solution to the problem outlined in the [Coding Assignment](./CodingAssignment.md).

## Libraries & Execution

[Rspec](http://rspec.info/) is the only library (gem) used in this solution.
This is intentional as it is part of the requirements.

If you do not already have Rspec run:
```
$ bundle install
```

The test suite can be executed as follows:
```
$ rspec spec/
```
